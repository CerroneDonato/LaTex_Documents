\begin{abstract} 
        The first test case is the steady-state development of incompressible flow between two parallel plates in the laminar regime (Figure~\\\ref{fig:sketch}). The plates are considered infinite in the direction transversal to the flow. The flow develops from a condition of uniform velocity (rectangular profile) imposed at the inlet boundary, reaching a fully-developed state at a certain distance downstream of it. \cite{FL:01}

\section{Introduction}
        The fully developed laminar flow between two parallel plates admits an analytical solution (plane Poiseuille flow):

        \begin{equation}
                \begin{cases}
                        u(x,y,z) = u(y) = - \frac{\delta ^ 2}{2 \mu} \frac{dp_e}{dx} \frac{y}{\delta} (2 - \frac{y}{\delta}) \; v(x,y,z) = 0 \; w(x,y,z) = 0 \\
                        \frac{dp_e}{dx} = const < 0 \\
                        \tau_{yx}(x,y,z) = - 2 \mu \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \right) = - \mu \frac{du}{dy} = \frac{dp_e}{dx} (\delta - y) = \tau_{yx}(y)
                \end{cases}
        \end{equation}

        Where \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, \( \delta \) is the half-distance between the plates, \(u, v, w\) are the velocity components along directions \( x, y, z \) (Figure~\ref{fig:sketch}), \( p_e \) is the excess pressure with respect to the hydrostatic component, and \( \tau_{yx} \) is the only nonzero shear stress. \cite{FL:01}

        The configuration of the problem is as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Length \( L = 10 \: cm \),
                \item Length \( L_p = 9 \: cm \),
                \item Half-channel height \(\delta = 5 \: mm\),
                \item Bulk velocity \( U_b = 5 \: mm/s \),
                \item Fluid: Water at \( 20^{\circ}C \; ( \rho = 998.23 \: kg/m^3\), \\ Kinematic Viscosity \( \nu = 1.006E-6 \: m^2/s ) \).
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \end{figure}

        \paragraph{Outline}
        The remainder of the report is organizedas follows: Section~\ref{sec:developed_flow} provides some gross estimate of the required \( L_p \) to achieve a fully-developed flow in terms of channel height; Section~\ref{sec:independence} shows how a suitable configuration of the cartesian computational mesh was found; Section~\ref{sec:CFD_validation} compares the simulated solution with the analytical model both graphically and numerically; Finally, Section~\ref{sec:vorticity} provides some analysis regarding the vorticity profile on both the developing and fully-developed region. It is worth noting that all simulations had a relative convergence tolerance of $ 1E-3 $ for all variables taken into consideration.

\section{Fully-developed flow conditions} \label{sec:developed_flow}

        The following profiles were taken from a simulation with a 40-by-40 mesh.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Fully_Developed_Analysis.png}
                \centering
                \caption{X-velocity Y-profile per delta-step}
                \label{fig:delta-steps}
        \end{figure}

        As we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:delta-steps}, the X-velocity Y-Profile stabilizes after roughly 4 deltas ($ 2 \: cm $), making our choice of an 18-delta channel with a 2-delta margin at the beginning ($ 10 \: cm $ total) more than enough for the case of study. From now on, unless said otherwise, all X-specific data was taken after 12 deltas into the actual channel ($ 7 \: cm $ from the origin of the X-axis).

\section{Grid independence study} \label{sec:independence}

        The following Grid-Independence study was performed by fixing 40 cells either along the X or Y axis, and then progressively increasing the amount of cells on the other axis until both X-velocity profile and Pressure-gradient convergence was observed.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Grid_Ind_U_Profiles.png}
                \centering
                \caption{X-velocity Y-profile per cell amount}
                \label{fig:grid_ind_u}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Grid_Ind_P_Gradient.png}
                \centering
                \caption{P-gradient vs cell amount}
                \label{fig:grid_ind_p}
        \end{figure}

        As we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:grid_ind_u}, X-refinement is pretty much irrelevant for the X-velocity derivative profile; nevertheless, such is not the case for the Pressure-gradient which, as we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:grid_ind_p}, did not stabilize after at least 35 cells across the X-axis.

        In the case of Y-refinement, 25 cells were enough to stabilize both the X-velocity derivative profile and average Pressure-gradient. Therefore, a 40-by-40 mesh kept being used for the remainder of the laboratory, since simulation times were low enough for a wide Y-refinement margin to not be a problem.
